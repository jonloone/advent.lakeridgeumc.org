“What do you get for the person on your list who already has
everything they need?”</p>

<p>Gifts at Christmas can be a great way to bless those around you and show
them the love of Christ in a tangible way. This December, if you’re feeling
the pressure of finding a loved one that perfect gift — or if you’re just
looking for ways to bless others in need — we encourage you to explore
World Vision’s gift catalogue. Their gifts allow you to honor people in your
life by making a life-changing donation in their name. <a href="https://www.worldvision.org/charitable-giving-news-stories/christmas-gift-guide" target="_blank">Learn more here.</a></p>
