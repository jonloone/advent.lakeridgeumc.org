As you and your family rest and relax this Saturday, take some
time to listen to the song “Come Thou Long Expected Jesus” and to
consider the comforting promises of its lyrics. For accompanying
Scripture, read through Isaiah 35 and Isaiah 53.</p>

<p>For further times of worship, join us tomorrow morning at one of our
services! We offer both traditional and contemporary worship services so
that there is something for everyone, and we would love for you to join
us.</p>
