Not only is the Advent season one of anticipation, it’s also
one of gratefulness. Spend some time this Tuesday thanking God for
sending his Son and for His abundant blessings to you and your family.
What is the best present you’ve ever received at Christmas? We
encourage you to thank God for both the steadfastness of His character
and for his tangible gifts in your life.</p>
