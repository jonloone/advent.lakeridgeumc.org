This Advent we are spending a few minutes each week reading
from J.D. Walt’s book “Reset: Advent Devotions for the Whole Family”. If
you are feeling busy and tired this Monday morning, we encourage you to
take some time to rest in Scripture — this week’s reading is called “The
Lord Lifts Up” and the PDF can be downloaded below.</p>
