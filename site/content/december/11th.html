This Advent we are spending a few minutes each week reading
from J.D. Walt’s book “Reset: Advent Devotions for the Whole Family”. If
you are feeling busy and tired this Monday morning, we encourage you to
take some time to rest in Scripture — this week’s reading is called <a href="/docs/dev2.pdf" target="_blank">“The
Lord Lifts Up”.</a></p>
