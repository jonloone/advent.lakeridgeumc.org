This week’s excerpt from J.D. Walt’s book “Reset: Advent
Devotions for the Whole Family” is all about resetting our priorities so that
God is first in our lives. This can be easy to forget during the busy days
leading up to Christmas, so we invite you to read <a href="/docs/dev3.pdf" target="_blank">this devotional</a> and
join us in redirecting our gaze towards the true reason for the season. </p>
