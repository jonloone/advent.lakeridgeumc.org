Music is an important way we can worship and reflect all
throughout the year, but especially during the Advent and Christmas
season.</p>


<p> Most of us hear the song “O Come, O Come, Emmanuel” many
times each December, but have you ever taken time to stop and truly
reflect on its lyrics? We encourage you to spend a few minutes today
listening to its rich refrains and celebrating Christ’s coming. If you
would like Scripture accompaniment, read Isaiah 60 and Isaiah 7:14.
</p>

<p>We also invite you to worship more with us tomorrow morning at one
of our services! We will be holding Lessons and Carols at 9:15 and
10:30 in the Sanctuary and 10:30 during LakeRidge Praise in the
Activity Center. Come be a part of this meaningful service where we
will tell the story of Christmas through Scripture and songs!</p>
