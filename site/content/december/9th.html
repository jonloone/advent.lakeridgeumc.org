Music is an important way we can worship and reflect all
throughout the year, but especially during the Advent and Christmas
season.</p>


<p> Most of us hear the song “O Come, O Come, Emmanuel” many
times each December, but have you ever taken time to stop and truly
reflect on its lyrics? We encourage you to spend a few minutes today
listening to its rich refrains and celebrating Christ’s coming. If you
would like Scripture accompaniment, read Isaiah 60 and Isaiah 7:14.
