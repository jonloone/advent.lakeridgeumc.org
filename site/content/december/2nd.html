		<p class="quote__intro">In a season of holiday haste and hustle, Advent causes us to slow down and
prepare. In a world of darkness and violence, the Church proclaims a message of light and
hope. In a world of division and fear, the coming of the Christ child reminds us of the healing
power of love.</p>

<p>
Whether or not you or your family have celebrated the Advent season before, we
encourage you to take a few minutes of your day to read more about it and the reasons why
we might strive to incorporate it into our daily routines this December.
</p>

<p>
We also encourage you and your family to <a href="lakeridgeumc.org">join us</a> at one of our services tomorrow as we
reflect and worship together as a community.</p>
