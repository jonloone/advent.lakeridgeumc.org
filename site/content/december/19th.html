Along with anticipation and gratefulness, Advent is also a
season of remembrance. Just as Christmas is a time of traditions and
reminiscing, it is also a time to remember Godâ€™s continued grace in our
lives and the ultimate gift of His Son.</p>

<p>
	Do you and your family have a favorite holiday tradition? Take time to
thank God for the fun of yearly traditions and for the blessing of His
daily grace.
