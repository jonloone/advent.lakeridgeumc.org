Prayer is powerful all year round, and the Advent season is no
exception. As we have taken time to reflect on Mary and Joseph and their
journey to Bethlehem , we encourage you to join
us in this prayer.

<div class="prayer">
	
	<p>“You are the Father who welcomes home
The prodigal who has wandered far
You are the Father who prepares a meal
When others would simply ignore
You are the Father whose love extends
Beyond our thoughts or minds
You are the Father who knows our hearts
And yet loves us as we are
You are the Father whose word we trust
In whose presence we have no fear
You are the Father whose tender touch
Makes a wounded spirit whole
You are the Father whose only Son
Was born that he might die
You are the Father whose gracious love
We celebrate this day. Amen”</p>
