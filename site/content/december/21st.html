Today’s Advent activity involves a challenge for you and your
family! The Christmas season is a unique opportunity for us to share the
love of Christ and the hope that we have in His coming to earth. It is also
a time when our church will welcome in many visitors who do not
otherwise attend services. We encourage you to join us in inviting a
neighbor or friend to one of Lakeridge’s Christmas Eve services! We hope
that these services will be a blessing not only to you and your family, but
also to those in Lubbock who are not yet part of a church community.</p>
