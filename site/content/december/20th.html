Prayer is powerful all year round, and the Advent season is no
exception. As we have taken time to reflect on Mary and Joseph and their
journey to Bethlehem , we encourage you to join
us in this prayer.

<div class="prayer">
	
	<p>“In this Advent of expectation
draw us together in unity,
that our praise and worship
might echo in these walls
and also through our lives.
In this Advent of expectation
draw us together in mission,
that the hope within
might be the song we sing,
and the melody of our lives.
In this Advent of expectation
draw us together in service,
that the path we follow
might lead us from a stable
to a glimpse of eternity.”</p>
