Prayer is powerful all year round, and the Advent season is no
exception. As we have taken time to reflect on Mary and Joseph and their
journey to Bethlehem , we encourage you to join
us in this prayer.

<div class="prayer">
	
	<p>“This Advent-time
we remember Mary and Joseph,
giving thanks for their faithfulness,
courage and obedience,
stepping out into the unknown
in the strength of your Spirit,
playing their part
in the fulfilment of your plan
to bring your prodigal people
home again.
We pray that their example
might be the pattern of our lives,
that when your gentle whisper
breaks through the clamour of this world
and into our small corner,
we might be ready to listen,
and having listened, to act.”</p>
