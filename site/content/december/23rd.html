Although written many decades ago, the lyrics of “O Holy
Night” are full of opportunities for joyful reflection and praise. We
encourage you to spend some time listening to the lyrics of this familiar
carol and rejoicing in our Savior!</p>

<p>We also invite you and your loved ones to you join us at one of our
Christmas Eve services tomorrow. There will be services at 10:30 a.m.,
4:00 p.m., and 6:00 p.m. in the Sanctuary and one at 5:00 p.m. in the
Activity Center (Lakeridge Praise). Come celebrate and worship with us!</p>
